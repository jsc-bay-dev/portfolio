                    Software engineering... it's honest, hard work that plays to my strengths, and it's something I strive to master. I enjoy solving complex problems, collaborating with others, and take pride in contributing to products and services that make a positive impact. I also derive a tremendous amount of comfort and joy in the fact that humanity's relationship with technology has had an incredibly stabilizing effect on economies all around the world, and it's a movement that I am thrilled to be a part of!
