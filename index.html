    <h4>July 31</h4>
    <p>One of my main love languages used to be how I'd talk about people. It started when I started to realize how
      wrong of an impression my friends from different circles were about each other. So whenever I'd see an opportunity
      to talk about why I loved them, I would. It used to piss me off, how surprised people would sometimes be. I knew
      it was because of the way they approached each other. The ones that come from stable families usually don't trust
      the rest of us enough. I think that's usually where the problem starts. What sets us apart is what we're taught to
      be sensitive about. I often times feel caught in between world. I personally think ptsd and depression deserve
      more empathy that substance abuse disorders. But I also know that ptsd and depression are both conditions that are
      a lot more difficult to understand without a much of a background in science. But we can't change the world over
      night. So what do we do? We turn them against each other. EVERYONE SUCKS BUT ME! MUAHAHAHHAA!
